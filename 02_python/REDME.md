# Python Operators

In Python, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

---

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+`      | Addition    | `5 + 3 = 8` |
| `-`      | Subtraction | `5 - 3 = 2` |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `5 * 3 = 15` |
| `/`      | Division    | `5 / 2 = 2.5` |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `5 // 2 = 2` |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `5 % 2 = 1` |
| `**`     | Exponentiation | `2 ** 3 = 8` |

---

## 2. Comparison Operators
Used to compare values, result is either `True` or `False`.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `==`     | Equal to    | `5 == 5 → True` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to | `5 != 3 → True` |
| `>`      | Greater than | `5 > 3 → True` |
| `<`      | Less than   | `5 < 3 → False` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `5 >= 3 → True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `5 <= 3 → False` |

---

## 3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `and`    | Returns True if both conditions are true | `(5 > 3 and 2 < 4) → True` |
| `or`     | Returns True if at least one condition is true | `(5 > 3 or 2 > 4) → True` |
| `not`    | Reverses the result | `not(5 > 3) → False` |

---

## 4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `=`      | `x = 5` | Assign value |
| `+=`     | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3` |
| `-=`     | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` |
| `*=`     | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |
| `/=`     | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3` |
| `//=`    | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3` |
| `%=`     | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` |
| `**=`    | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3` |

---

## 5. Bitwise Operators
Used to perform operations on binary numbers.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&`      | AND         | `5 & 3 = 1` |
| `|`      | OR          | `5 | 3 = 7` |
| `^`      | XOR         | `5 ^ 3 = 6` |
| `~`      | NOT         | `~5 = -6` |
| `<<`     | Left Shift  | `5 << 1 = 10` |
| `>>`     | Right Shift | `5 >> 1 = 2` |

---

## 6. Identity Operators
Used to compare objects, not values.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is`     | Returns True if both variables point to the same object | `x is y` |
| `is not` | Returns True if both variables do not point to the same object | `x is not y` |

---

## 7. Membership Operators
Used to test if a sequence contains a value.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `in`     | Returns True if value is found in sequence | `'a' in 'apple' → True` |
| `not in` | Returns True if value is not found in sequence | `'x' not in 'apple' → True` |

---

## Summary
- Arithmetic Operators → Perform math operations  
- Comparison Operators → Compare values  
- Logical Operators → Combine conditions  
- Assignment Operators → Assign and modify values  
- Bitwise Operators → Work with binary numbers  
- Identity Operators → Compare object memory location  
- Membership Operators → Check membership in sequences
